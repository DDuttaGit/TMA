Construction of the transformer network $\mathcal{U}$ (see the diagram above) has been algorithmically achieved using Restricted Access Sequence Programming [^1]. Realization of such a conceptual representation of $\mathcal{U}$ can be implemented using `Tracr` [^2].

Implementation of fundamental matrix operations and activations has been attached in this repository.
